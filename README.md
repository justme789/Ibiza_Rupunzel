# Saving Ibiza Rupunzel

This is just a project that I'll be working on in my free time. This is to be a text based
game where what you type drastically influences how the game plays out. This project is mainly
built on javaFX.

I'm hoping i could refine my coding skills by doing this. You will find a file named Story.txt
please feel free to add to it or even implement the stuff mentioned there if you feel like it.

To test the game please run Portfolio.jar (You should have java installed and in your path).

The game doesnt do much at the moment but it is a working concept for what is yet to come!

Current commands

questions = { "what", "who", "when", "how", "why", "does", "has", "can", "shall", "is", "which", "did",
"where" }
movement = { "move", "walk" }
travel = { "travel", "go", "head" }
greetings = { "hi", "hello", "morning", "goodmorning", "sup", "whatsup", "what'sup", "hey", "yo" }
