Saving Ibiza Rupunzel

The Story
There is a narrator who walks you through your adventure after you wake up
in an unknown shack in a forest where you are greeted by the "narrator".
The Narrator tries to explain what happened but to no avail. You've lost your
memory. The narrator will explain the controls and how everything works

          -----------------------------------------------------
          Vague:-
          Something about a city where you can meet characters
          and accept quests. Money will be a factor. Quests can
          be story related and none story related. Each individual
          path will have its own missions


          The regaining memory one will require a sacrifice
            You will have to lose someone you love

          The Castle one will require incredible money
            Make money from quests and selling items

          The saving the princess will require incredible strength
            Level up

          The making friends of all species onewill require so much time
            Meet and get to hang out with different species

          -----------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Concept

There will be multiple paths to success(too much?) where you can win by
completing one path or multiple paths.

breakdown and narrator fight should be in there

Path 1: Castle.
Path 2: Re-gain Memory
Path 3: Make friends of all species(Species? Do you pick your own?)
Path 4: Saving The Princess



You introduce yourself by giving your name. You will have a set integer for
health, and strength. You'll be able to level up which will increase all your
previously mentioned stats.

The narrator will have a "mood" based on how you talk to them. They can get
really mean
